# Cheeta clip
The Cheeta clip holds flat objects onto a rack. It is made for deploying small solar photovoltaic (PV) modules outdoors.

## Features
- Very fast, tool-less attachment to a rack
- Very fast, tool-less installation and removal of samples
- Fully 3D-printable
- Uses about USD 0.10 worth of material per clip

## Usage
Position rails according to the *rail slot spacing* in the version table below.

Set the springs inside of each clip.

Install at least two upper clips in the upper rail using a quarter-twist.

## Versions
version | rail type | sample thickness range | clip overlap | rail slot spacing

A | 80-20 15 series | 3 mm–8 mm | 5 mm | sample height − 23 mm

## Printing recommendations
### Slicing and printing
We make Cheeta clips using ordinary FFF 3D printers. We use a 0.6-mm nozzle. We slice with 4 perimeters to strengthen the inside corner fillet and use 15% infill.

### Material
We use white PETG, which should last at least several months outdoors while holding adequate spring tension.

PLA is not recommended because it creeps at room temperature and loses spring tension overnight.
